This repository includes customer review analysis using NLP.

Business Context:
One of the leading woman clothing e-commerce companies would like to analyse the customer’s behaviour by analysing customer’s demographics and reviews submitted on the website.

Business Objectives:
Our main goals include conducting exploratory data analysis to discern patterns, employing text mining for positive and negative sentiment, and generating word clouds for each category. Additionally, we aim to analyze sentiment across various dimensions such as categories, subcategories, products by location, and age groups. Furthermore, predictive analytics will be applied to identify the factors influencing customer recommendations, and topic mining will be utilized to uncover themes behind identified topics.

Anticipated outputs from the team include a comprehensive exploratory analysis with a dashboard featuring word clouds, frequency plots, and sentiment analysis across channels, locations, categories, subcategories, and age groups. Additionally, predictive analysis tasks will involve topic mining and classification models to predict customers likely to recommend products and forecast ratings based on reviews.
